PART I – Application: Load and overview data related to your theme 
Lload the data and identify its key aspects (number of samples/instances, number of dimensions/features/attributes, number of classes, names of classes, number of samples per class).

PART II – Application: Clustering 
a)	Using clustering methods to partition the dataset.
b)	Evaluate the clustering methods using appropriate metrics such as the Adjusted Rand index, Homogeneity, Completeness and V-Measure, using the ground truth.
c)	Consider and implement any configuration of the parameters of the clustering methods that could further improve the results.
PART III – Application: Classification: Training and Testing

a)	Using classification methods to distinguish between the classes. Both the following training/testing protocols used:
•	Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%).
•	K-fold cross-validation for K=10.
b)	For both protocols, evaluate the classification approaches using appropriate metrics such as the Balanced Accuracy, F1-Score and ROC AUC. In addition, draw ROCs for all classification methods into a single graph to allow for easy comparison between methods.
c)	Consider and implement any configuration of the parameters of the classification methods that could further improve the results.
